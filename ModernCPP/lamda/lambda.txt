Lambda vs function objects

Function objects - > overlaoding
Lambda  -> It is a variant of function(not sure)
        -> const function object
        -> lambdas are const by default but adding mutable keyword makes them constexpr

square, circle curly brackets
[&] (x, y) mutable throw() -> int

Square bracket [] -> capture list
-> trailing return type
throw(): its throw an exception by default
-> int: not necessary to mention if nothing to return


[](){}

// syntax
[&] (x, y) mutable throw() -> int 
{
    int sum = x + y;
    x = 0;
    y = 0;

    return sum;
}
