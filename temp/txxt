**Here's a basic C++ program structure for a library management system, incorporating modern C++ best practices and the core entities and methods outlined in the previous response:**

**1. Header Files:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <memory> // For smart pointers
#include <algorithm> // For searching and sorting
// Additional headers for database interaction (if applicable)
```

**2. Namespace:**

```c++
namespace library_system {

// Classes and functions will be defined within this namespace
}
```

**3. Classes:**

```c++
namespace library_system {

class Book {
public:
    std::string isbn;
    std::string title;
    std::string author;
    // ... other book attributes

    // Constructors, getters, setters, and book-related methods
};

class Member {
public:
    int member_id;
    std::string name;
    std::string email;
    // ... other member attributes

    // Constructors, getters, setters, and member-related methods
};

class Library {
public:
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Book>> books;
    std::vector<Member> members;

    // Methods for managing books, members, and library operations
};
}
```

**4. Main Function:**

```c++
int main() {
    library_system::Library library;

    // Program loop to interact with the library system
    while (true) {
        // Display menu of options (add book, remove book, search book, etc.)
        // Get user choice
        // Call appropriate library methods based on user choice
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**5. Implementation of Methods:**

```c++
// Implementation of Book, Member, and Library class methods
// (Refer to the previous response for suggested methods)
```

**6. Additional Considerations:**

- **Database Integration:** 
    - Choose a suitable database library and integrate it for persistent data storage.
- **User Interface:** 
    - Implement a user-friendly interface (console-based, GUI, or web-based) for interaction.
- **Error Handling:** 
    - Use exceptions or error codes for robust error handling.
- **Security:** 
    - Implement appropriate security measures (password protection, data encryption, etc.) if applicable.
- **Testing and Validation:** 
    - Thoroughly test the system with various scenarios to ensure its correctness and robustness.
